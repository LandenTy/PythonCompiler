# PythonCompiler
I was getting really tired of how slow python was, no matter how many optimizations I make it is still SUPER SLOW. So I am writing a compiler to make python a compiled language instead of an interpreted one

# How to Use:

```bash
quantum hello.py -o hello.exe
```

Everything should compile successfully, and the program should run in the command

# Dependencies

This repository does depend on NASM (Netwide Assembler) as well as GCC for linking, I do plan on adding
a linker into the repository at some point. As well as an assembler, if all goes well
